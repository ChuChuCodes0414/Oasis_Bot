# Oasis_Bot
A useful discord bot with various features. You can look through the cogs for more information on features! If you have any questions, feel free to message me on discord at ChuGames#0001 (ID 570013288977530880).

Written using discord.py in python, along with various supporting libraries.

The bot has hit the server cap of 100 servers! You can still invite the clone bot Serenity Bot. Serenity Bot is a bot running on the same code as Oasis Bot, but without the music for bandwidth reasons. For more information, click the "bot cap post" link below!

**Update 1/27/2023: This bot is no longer maintained, and a rewritten version is coming soon!**
